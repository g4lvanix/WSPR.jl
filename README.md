# WSPR.jl

A Julia implementation of the popular WSPR amateur radio digital mode. 

Mostly a reimplementation of existing C code from the wsjtx code base.

Started as a learning project to demistify the magic of pulling weak 
signals out of the noise and using strong FEC to recover the original message.
